Q1 What is the InputStreamReader class meant for?

ANS: This class is used for decoding incoming streams of bytes to produce streams of characters.


Q2 What does the explanation say to do for best efficiency? Write the suggested statement.

ANS: Wrapping the InputStreamReader within a BufferedReader;
	BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        

Q3 What method do you use to read a line from an input stream? What does it return?

ANS: readLine() - Returns a String containing the contents of the line or null if end reached


Q4 What does the method, println(String x) do? What does it return?

ANS: It doesn't return anything (return type void), it prints a String and then terminates the line


Q5 What does the constructor ServerSocket(int port) do?

ANS: This constructs an instance of the ServerSocket class with the parameter port - the port number of the port which the ServerSocket will be bound to (The one it will listen to).


Q6 What does the method accept() do? What does it return?

ANS: This method listens for a connection to be made and accepts it unless an exception is caught. It returns 's' - the new socket.


Q7 Which constructor do you think is the most appropriate?

ANS: Socket(InetAddress address, int port) - IP address and port number


Q8 What does the method getInputStream() return?

ANS: The input stream from the Socket it's called on for reading bytes.


Q9 What method would you use to have a socket use an OutputStream?

ANS: getOutputStream()


Q10 When you use the default constructor to create an instance of Date, what is it initialized with?

ANS: The time at which it was allocated, measured to the nearest millisecond.


Q11 Write the code fragment required to print the current date and time to standard output.

ANS: System.out.println(Date().toString());


Q12 In the Usage error message, what is meant by <port> [host]?

ANS: <port> is the port which we are using to communicate, [host] is the machine which we are trying to talk to
